# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of my 1-month internship at **Zephyr Technologies Pvt. Ltd** from **19 May to 19 June 2025**.  
It focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using various machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- **CSV Dataset** (`heart_disease.csv`)

---

## 📊 Project Highlights
